## This is about the sampling in Baysien network for the final project of Probability Graphical Model Course
The python scripts is for building the probability model(Baysien network),  sampling and the compute the MLE. The report is also included.
To automatic generate the probability models, you can use builBN in bn_builder.py:
    builBN(hand_addG,number_of_edge_list,skew,merge_component=True)
